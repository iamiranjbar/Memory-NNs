# Memory-NNs

This is the fourth project of Neural Network course at the University of Tehran.

We developed basic memory neural networks from scratch.

We learn about Hebbian rule, Auto Associative network, Hopfield network and Bidirectional Associative Memory(BAM) to remember digits representation with some noise.
